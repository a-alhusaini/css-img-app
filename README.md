# CSS to IMG - The little HTML/CSS to Image site

Thanks for visiting my repo!

I host the daarb podcast/blog where I talk about software development. When you make content online you'll need to create some nice images to improve the quality of your content.

But for me, there was a catch...

The problem was that I couldn't see very well. Tools like GIMP are great. But when you can barely see the mouse pointer, it becomes obvious that GIMP just wont cut it.

I was stuck. I wanted to make images for my content, but to do that, I needed to be able to use a tool like gimp. But my eyes refused to cooperate.

That's when I ran into [html-to-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image). After I read the readme I started to see the matrix. And that is how this project came to be.

css-img-app is a simple website that lets you write html and css then convert them into a png image. It is build with svelte and vite. You can run it on your machine with the usual `git clone` + `npm run dev` combination. Check it out via this link:
